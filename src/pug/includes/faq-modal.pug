                                    InkStory works by seamlessly matching the tattoo on your skin with the pre-uploaded
                                    image. If the images match successfully, the app unleashes the sound you attached to
                                    the image, creating a captivating audio experience. This unique functionality allows
                                    you to fine-tune and adjust the image if needed, ensuring a perfect match between
                                    your tattoo and the original picture you created.

                                    InkStory supports up to 3 tattoos for each user. If you have a single
                                    tattoo that is large in size, you can upload different parts of the tattoo and
                                    assign the same sound to each section. This unique feature allows you to scan any
                                    part of your tattoo and unlock the sound of the entire design, providing a cohesive
                                    audio experience that encompasses the entirety of your artwork.

                                    adding them to InkStory. The process is simple: just upload a photo of your tattoo
